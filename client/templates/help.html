### How to use
***
If you haven't signed up yet, you can only see channel chats and those users who have signed up. You cannot send any messages.

Once you have signed up by creating an account, you successfully join the team.

#### After sign up
You can change your profile __avatar__ and __status__ in the _[profile](/profile)_ page.

You can create a channel with a unique name (_alphanumeric_ character including _underscore_ only).

You can initiate a private chat with any user currently in the team.

You can quit a channel or delete a private chat. However, the chat messages will still be in the system. You can configure your chat data in the _[config](/config)_ page.

You can favourite any chat session which will appear in a seperate section in the menu sidebar.

#### Sending messages
You can send two types of messages:

* __channel__ message: which can be seen by all users in this channel
* __direct__ message: which can only be seen by the sender and receiver

The input box is a _textarea_ which supports __multi-line__ message. Simply press `enter` to insert a new line feed in the message.
